# net.loadbang.clojure

This package is an implementation of Clojure for [MaxMSP][max].

Tutorials, exercises and prebuilt JAR files are available in a
[companion project][clojure-expo]. This `net.loadbang.clojure`
project provides sources and a Maven build script. (To do the
Maven build, clone and build [net.loadbang.scripting][scripting]
first, since our libraries are not yet in a central repository.)

This project is also going to be the home for more advanced examples
(such as those demonstrating different Max objects communicating with
one another).

See the README for [net.loadbang.lib][lib] for installation details.
